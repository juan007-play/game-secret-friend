<h1>'Game The Secret Friend'</h1>

- Project status: Finished!!!
Welcome to Secret Friend! To get started, add your friends' names to the list by typing them in the input field and clicking "AÃ±adir." After you've added everyone, click the orange "Sortear amigo" button. Behind the scenes, the game uses JavaScript's Math.random() and Math.floor() functions to select one person at random from your list, ensuring a fair and exciting result.
